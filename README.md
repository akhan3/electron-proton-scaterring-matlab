Differential equation solver for electron-proton scattering


This is a MATLAB code which uses the built-in ode45 solver to solve the equation of motion for electron-proton scattering. 
The code puts the proton at the origin (0,0) and puts the electron at a random position in the grid with a random velocity. 
The code then generates the animation by time marching the equation of motion.
